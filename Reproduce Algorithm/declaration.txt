All the replicated code in this article is run based on a specific dataset. This dataset is obtained by further segmenting a dataset that has been processed using a gesture segmentation algorithm on the original dataset, resulting in a dataset containing 600 samples. It should be noted that the code in this article does not demonstrate the gesture segmentation algorithm. This declaration is made to clarify the data basis and source for the code operation.
